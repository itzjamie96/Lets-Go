# 1. Go 101

- fast, statically typed, compiled language
  - compiled down to machine level code => doesn't need to be interpreted one line by line 
  - variable types are checked by compiler
  - cannot change variable after declaration
- general purpose language
- built-in testing support
- object-oriented language



## Go in VSCode

- add the "Go" extension
- make a new `.go` file and install the recommended packages



## main()

```go
// a collection of code. mostly called "main"
// "main" => compiled as an executable program
package main

// package from the "go standard library"
// in GOPATH
// "fmt" = format strings
import "fmt"

// entry point of the application
// go will look for the "main" function
// only one "main" function allowed in a package
func main() {

	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```



### Run your `.go` file

- open a terminal
- enter `go run file.go`
