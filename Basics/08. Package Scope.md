# 8. Package Scope

- different functions in different **files** still can interact if they are parts of the **same package**
  - ex. `main.go` and `greetings.go` should both be in `package main` to use functions from each other
  - but both files should be run separately
    - ex. if `main.go` includes functions of `greetings.go`, both files should be run
