# 16. Saving into a File

Steps of saving into a file

1. format the data you are trying to save into a slice of bytes
2. set the `os.WriteFile(location to save, data to save, permission of file mode)`
3. check if there was an error with step 2

```go
// save the bill into a file
func (b *bill) saveBill() {

	// format the bill and make it into a slice of bytes
	data := []byte(b. format())

	// write into a file
	// save location, data to write, permission
	// this will return an error
	err := os.WriteFile("bills/"+b.name+".txt", data, 0644)

	// if there is an error,
	if err != nil {
		// stop the flow of the program and print the error
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Bill was saved into .txt")
}
```

- make sure your saving directory is valid
- `panic()` will stop the program and return the error type
