# 06. Slice

- A slice is just like an array

  - same type of elements can be held
  - but lenght can be omitted

  ```go
  var mySlice []int
  ```

- For the most part, slices work just like arrays

  - accessing elements through index
  - initialization with zero values
  - for loops / for...range loops

- A slice literal looks like an array literal, but with the length omitted

  ```go
  mySlice := []int{1,7,10}
  ```

- Slices are built on top of arrays

  - you can make a slice from an existing array using index

    ```go
    underlyingArr := [5]string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"}
    
    slice1 := underlyingArr[0:3]
    fmt.Println(slice1)  //[a b c]
    ```

  - A slice starts from `i` to `j-1`

- Changing the underlying array will also change the slice
  - it's generally better to create slices using `make` or a slice literal than creating a slice from an array

- Values can be added to a sice using `append()`
  ```go
  slice := []string{"a", "b"}
  slice = append(slice, "c")
  ```
